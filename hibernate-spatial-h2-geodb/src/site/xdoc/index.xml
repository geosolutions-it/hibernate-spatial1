			<p>
				The H2 GeoDB Provider adds support for H2 GeoDB to
				Hibernate
				Spatial. It has been tested with H2 GeoDB 0.3
				and should work with
				any version later than that.
			</p>

			<subsection name="Important notes" />
			<ul>
				<li>
					Note that H2 GeoDB does not completely implement the OGC Simple
					Feature Specification.
					Some functions that work for PostGIS or
					Oracle
					may fail to work for H2
					GeoDB.
				</li>
				<li>
					Note that version 0.3 does not store the SRID with the geometry.
					This is
					due to an omission in the JTS API. Version 0.4 solved this
					issue by
					extending the JTS API, but the fix was committed in the
					opengeo
					repository. To use version 0.4, you have to include the
					GeoTools Maven repository (
					<a href="http://repo.opengeo.org/org.locationtech/jts/1.12-SNAPSHOT/">http://repo.opengeo.org/org.locationtech/jts/1.12-SNAPSHOT/
					</a>
					) and you cannot use other JTS versions.
				</li>
				<li>
					Note that EWKT byte arrays generated by GeoDB version 0.6 (with
					GeoDB.gToEWKB(Geometry)) seem to have redundant bytes at positions
					42-45, resulting in a incorrect EWKT. As a result, accessing
					EKWT
					objects in the database generated by GeoDB.gToEWKB with
					hibernate-spatial may give jts Parse Exceptions.
